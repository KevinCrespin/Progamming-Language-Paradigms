2pts) Create a function that adds two Ints together. Then create a function, using partial application of the first, that adds a number to 10. 

2pts) Using partial application/currying, create a function that checks if a Char is a lowercase letter

2pts) Write a function like zipWith, except that it takes 3 lists and a function that takes 3 parameters, and returns a list with the function applied to each corresponding element in the 3 lists

2pts) Write a function that takes a function (Int -> Int) and an Int and returns (Int, Int), where the first element is the Int
without the function applied to it, and the second is the result  of applying the function to the Int. That is, if we call the function toTuple, toTuple (+3) 6 should return (6, 9)

2pts) Using map and the function you just wrote, write a function that takes a list of Ints and a function (Int -> Int) and returns a new list of tuples, with the first element being the original element, and the second being the result of the transformation.

e.g. [1,2,3] becomes [(1,1), (2, 4), (3, 9)] if the function passed in returns the square of an element
